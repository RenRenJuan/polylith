# Fork of clj-polylith 
<span style="font-size: 12px">Divergence from original devloper's pkg:</span>

 jtengstrand.md has the original developer's readme.

> "Polylith" is a pun based meme which has been associated with more than one software system.
> The original systems were lisp and particularly CLOS based, but this one is clojure and thus java based.
> For background to this point see the #lisp log fragment referred to in the repo about text.

 precis of intent in my dev scope

> MIL and a "polylith" fit some intentions for downstream applications programming

So forked for that purpose, the divergence will be substantial if this engages for the above intened 
purpose. A later recovery of original MIL sources could affect this and should the upstream package 
evolve into more of an MIL, the natural thing would be to drop the fork if it were adequate as such.
