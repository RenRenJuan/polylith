# Fork of clj-polylith 
<span style="font-size: 12px">Divergence from original devloper's pkg:</span>

 jtengstrand.md has the original developer's readme.

> "Polylith" is a pun based meme which has been associated with more than one software system.
> The original systems were lisp and particularly CLOS based, but this one is clojure and thus java based.
> For background to this point see the #lisp log fragment referred to in the repo title blurb.

 precis of intent in my dev scope

> MIL and a "polylith" fit some intentions for downstream applications programming 
> including those for graphical programming as in National Instruments G lang.
> I would use clj-polylith directly if it were more connected with its tradition 
> and may do so directly should a java based element of my current interests call for
> and one in particular (jitsi) is likely to.
