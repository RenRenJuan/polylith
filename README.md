# Fork of clj-polylith 
<span style="font-size: 12px">Divergence from original devloper's pkg</span>


 "Polylith" is a pun based meme which has been associated with more than one software system.
 The original systems were lisp and particularly CLOS based, but this one is clojure and thus java based.

 jtengstrand.md has the original developer's readme.
