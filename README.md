# Fork of clj-polylith 
<span style="font-size: 12px">Divergence from upstream pkg:</span>

 jtengstrand.md has the original developer's readme.

> "Polylith" is a pun based meme which has been associated with more than one software system.

So forked for that purpose, the divergence will be substantial if this engages for the above intended 
purpose. A later discovery of a working MIL (particularly the original Polylith)  could affect this and should the upstream package 
evolve into more of an MIL, then would want to drop this fork and use the upstream, with my adaptations applied external to it.
